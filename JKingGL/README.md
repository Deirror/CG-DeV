# JKingGL

This project is based on the videos of *Jamie King* for *OpenGL - Computer Graphics*

As it is an old one, I will just use modern libs and try to follow the videos

> [!NOTE]
> This project is with better abstraction than the *ChernoGL* one - there I just wanted things to work
> 
> Here we have a more organized project, which hopefully will grow more by each day
