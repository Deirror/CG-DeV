# ChernoGL

I decided to write the code, while watching *The Cherno* collection of videos, called *OpenGL*. 

I saw that it can be directly used as a template for drawing objects instantly and with fine abstraction, 
so everyone can clone this/copy the entire solution as I have linked the most important libraries for OpenGL.

> [!NOTE]
> It comes with an examplary main.cpp, which draws *The Cherno* logo(Texture obj) and changes the color of the image(passed to the fragment shader)
